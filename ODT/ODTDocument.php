 * Main class/API for creating an ODTDocument.
 * 
 * Work in progress!!! Goals:
 * 
 * - Move all pure ODT specific code away from the ODT-DokuWiki
 *   renderer class in page.php/book.php
 * 
 * - Make the ODT DokuWiki renderer classes only call functions in this
 *   class directly to have a single class only which is seen/used by
 *   the renderer classes
